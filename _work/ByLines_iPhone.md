Bylines is an application for helping people scout popular exhibits and attractions in a local area. Features include maps and addresses; distance from a userâ€™s current location; amount of time to travel to the location by walking, driving or public transportation; iconography showing how long it takes to go through the attraction; and a color indicator showing wait times for entry.  This was an independent contract where I worked with the User Experience Designer of a start-up company to conceptualize and visualize the application.
