Bloomberg Wealth is a financial and business application used to view data, analytics, news, charts, and can also be used to manage finances and a stock network. Bloomberg Wealth caters to the needs of financial planners and investment advisors. I worked with the Associate Creative Director in an assistant role. I designed specific pages of the web application, the data visualization, and collaborating with the development team.
