Paperless Post's Create application is another product I created as a Paperless Post tool offered to its customers. The application helps the user to select a card; edit the card by personalizing the styling and content; send the invitation by email; and track if the invitee accepted or decllned. As Lead Visual Designer, I designed the graphic user interfaces and customer experience for the mobile products.
