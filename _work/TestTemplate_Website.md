The Self-Editing Test Template allows the user to create an interactive test format that facilitates editing without having to recreate the initial template for each new additional content. When a new question is added, jQuery automates the format and styling of the question and places it on the webpage. This was created as a individual project in the General Assemblyâ€™s Web Development Immersive program that builds upon my user interface design experience and new development skills.
