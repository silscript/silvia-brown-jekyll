PushBox is a notifications manager application that takes the headache and annoyance out of the constant bombardment of dozens of daily notification reminders. PushBox allows the user to store notifications in a single location; view them on a user-defined schedule; categorize notifications by keyword content; and read a single message that consolidates rather than duplicates similar content. This was an independent contract where I worked with the Product Manager and User Experience Designer of a start-up company to conceptualize and visualize the application.
