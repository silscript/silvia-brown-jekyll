Paperless Post is a private e-commerce company headquartered on Wall Street, New York. Paperless Post modernized traditional modes of communication by creating and selling  personalized online invitations and stationery cards customized to reflect an individual aesthetic. As Lead Visual Designer, I designed the graphic user interfaces and customer experience for both web and mobile products. The goal of the new redesign and experience was to simplify the workflow to search, design, and send a card or invitation. I led the visual team to use best practices in design to produce high quality mock-ups, assets, style guides for engineers, managers, and senior stakeholders.
