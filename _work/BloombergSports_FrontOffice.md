Bloomberg Sports' Front Office delivers ground breaking tools with analytical insights, stats, and information for local sports fans and sports fantasy players. Front Office is a user-friendly online application that integrates data from CBS Sports, ESPN, and Yahoo Sports. The application provides comprehensive insights for the fantasy manager who wants to win; offers recommendations; evaluates players; and updates fantasy league standings. The Front Office application operates on multiple platforms and devices, such as iPad, iPhone, and Android. For this work, I was part of a team and worked closely with the Associate Creative Director to design parts of the application. I also worked closely with the development team to ensure that the design was pixel perfect.
