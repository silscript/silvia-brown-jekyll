Paperless Post's Albums was a conceptual application whose goal was to facilitate the instantaneous storage and sharing of photos taken during a live event. The application enhances the experience of guests, particularly at a large event. The storage feature allows guests to look back at the event and see other guestsâ€™ comments about the photos.
