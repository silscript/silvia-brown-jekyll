UpWord Notes is an application that facilities quick and easy capturing of ideas that syncs directly with the userâ€™s DropBox account. This in turn allows the user to export information to any mobile device and share it with others. UpWord Notes has additional features that make it easy to organize ideas; search by keyword; character count; and review and edit content. This was an independent contract where I worked with the Product Manager of a start-up company to conceptualize and visualize the application.
