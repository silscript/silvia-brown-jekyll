Bloomberg Sports' Trade Analyzer is an iPad application for building and analyzing fantasy baseball trades. The application syncs directly with CBS Sports, ESPN, or Yahoo Sports to provide customized advice to sports fan users based on fantasy league settings and rosters. It recommends specific trades and demonstrates how they affect user stats and offers powerful algorithms to tell the user if a trade is good or bad for the fantasy team. Once the user builds the perfect trade, the application enables the user to open their fantasy provider and make an offer that canâ€™t be refused. As one of two Visual Designers on the Front Office team, I led the design of the Trade Analyzer application for both iPad and iPhone.
